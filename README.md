A simple and interactive slider CAPTCHA that requires users to drag or slide a ball from left to right to verify they are human. Designed to improve user experience while adding a layer of bot protection.

Features
Smooth slider animation using CSS and JavaScript

Mobile-friendly (supports tap & hold)

Tracks user interaction to differentiate between humans and bots (with JavaScript backend validation planned)

Lightweight and easy to integrate into any web project

How It Works
Users must drag the red ball from the left end of the slider track to the right end. The interaction is tracked to prevent automated bots from bypassing the verification.
